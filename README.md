Proposal:
Hypothesis: There is a correlation between the consumption of healthy foods and the average income level of households across the United States. 

Our reasearch examines this correlation by analyzing the relationship between consumption, food types, and income levels.
US Choropleth layers update based on user mouse-over of one of the overlays. Each layer ranks the states by one of three factors: Median Income, Food Security, and Vegetable Consumption. Income data was pulled from the US Census; Food Security was pulled from the US Department of Agriculture; Vegetable Consumption survey was referenced from data compiled by America's Health Rankings (.org), a project from the United Health Foundation. By measuring household income by commodity consumption we can gather a sound conclusion to either reject or accept our hypothesis.
